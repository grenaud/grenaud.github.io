Robbie Holmes ([@robbiethegeek](https://twitter.com/robbiethegeek)) gave a
fantastic talk at TechTalkDC yesterday. Robbie is a fountain of wisdom and the
DC tech community is lucky to have him.

Here are my notes and takeaways:

## Understand your privilege

- Not everyone grew up the same way you did.

## Two big impacts of imposter syndrome

- Staying at a job that's boring or tedious way longer than you should.
- Worry people will find out you're a fraud.

## Getting acqui-hired is the best way to bring out your imposter syndrome

- (Zagat to Google)
- Didn't get interviewed, placed in a "web developer" position
- Everyone at Google works off of HEAD so you feel like you're constantly breaking things!
- "It was me saying I didn't have the skills"

## Joining USDS

- Folks with a ton of empathy and a lot of experience
- Healthcare application for Department of Veteran Affairs in node and react
- React was not core competency
- Team decided to move over to rails first week in

## Community is important

- Transitioning from being an attendee to organizer - fake it til you make it
- People start looking up to you

## Staying up to date on trends

- Podcasts
- Blogs
- Social media
- Know how you learn best

## Learn one new skill at a time

- Maybe don't switch editors when you're learning a new language
- Focus on one thing
- Reduce context switching from what you know to what you're learning

## Imposter syndrome coping strategy

- Become a part of the community
  - if you're going to tech events, you're probably in the top 25% of people at your level because you're learning from others
  - Speakers are in the top 10%
  - Most people don't engage in community, just because you're here you are ahead of the curve
- Fake it in public
  - host a lunch and learn
  - present at conferences or meetups
  - become an organizer

## Fin
