Disposable diapers are quite convenient but generate large quantities of non-biodegradable waste. In an effort to have a sustainable approach to parenting, my wife and I did a lot of investigation regarding sustainable solutions to the diaper problem. I wanted to share what we have learned. 

First, a lot of disposable eco-diapers are complete "green washing". They use labels filled with words like 100% natural but we have never found a disposable biodegradable diaper. 

We therefore opted for reusable washable diapers. It should be noted that this solution uses products sold in Europe, I will use some German words, I do not know the English translation, sorry! First, there is the Mullwindeln, this is the fabric that has direct contact with the skin of the baby. Now the problem is that, a single Mullwindeln does not absorb much. So for the night, this is not great. We therefore added a bamboo layer to absorb a bit more. To clean up,  we opted for muslin face cloth. They are also useful to clean up food on his face. This is a picture of the Mullwindeln, Bambus layer and muslin face cloth:

We use "snappies" to tie them together. Then comes the external part. We what are the material that could absorb humidity and was biodegradable. The problem with the lot of washable diapers that contain polyester. We therefore opted for wool. We purchased these Uberhosen that go on top of the Mullwindeln. They are easy to put on and the keep the baby warm and his clothes dry. This is the Uberhosen and snappies:

We found the system convenient. There are several online tutorials that show how to fold the Mullwindeln. First, there is the folding when they are very little (0-5 months old):

Then the "Drachen" (kite) folding when they are older:

Now the problems. First then means that your washing machine will run on average once per 2-days with a washing cycle at 60 degrees. Also, the Mullwindeln will become more and more taunt that means that they are harder to fold. The Uberhosen also shrink plus you need to wash up with a special soap. 

However, I would recommend the system. We are all responsible for moving towards sustainability.
